# 00pium - Music Tour Website

This is my first website project, originally created years ago and recently modernized with a fresh, contemporary design. The site showcases the Opium record label, its artists, history, and tour dates.

## 🎨 About This Project

This website was my first foray into web development. It started as a simple HTML/CSS project and has been recently updated with:

- Modern design system with gradients and animations
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Clean, organized file structure
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Active navigation states
- Professional typography

## 🚀 Features

- **Home Page**: Introduction to the Opium label and its music style
- **Artists Page**: Profiles of Playboi Carti, Ken Carson, Destroy Lonely, and Homixide Gang
- **History Page**: The story of how Opium Records was formed and evolved
- **Tour Page**: Upcoming tour dates with ticket links

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with modern features like CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS Variables)
- JavaScript (for navigation active states)
- Vite (for development server)
